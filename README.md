# Go MPD Discord RPC
It's what it says in the title, it basically "pipes" what you're playing in MPD to Discord and displays it as a Rich Presence

# Dependencies
1. Go, duh
2. MPD, duh
3. [gompd module](https://github.com/fhs/gompd)
4. [discord-rpc module](https://github.com/rikkuness/discord-rpc)

# Usage
Just do `go run ./main.go`, it'll run until it's stopped

# Current status
Functional, though I'd like to work on it a bit more, provided I had the time
